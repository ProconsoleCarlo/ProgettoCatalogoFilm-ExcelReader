This project was developed in spare time, between university courses, during fall 2014, for sure actively between
20/09/2014 and 16/11/2014.

The purpose is to provide a GUI for the catalog of movies that I have seen and that is saved in an xlsx file, with the
purpose of simplifying the search for the details of the films.

It was written with Java 7, but it still works with Java 17.
It uses [Apache POI OOXML](https://poi.apache.org/components/spreadsheet/index.html) to manage the xlsx file.

## Install

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

Execute the following main class: `TestMain02`
