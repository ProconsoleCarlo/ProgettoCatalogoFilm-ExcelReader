This project was developed in spare time, between university courses, during fall 2014, for sure actively between 20/09/2014 and 16/11/2014.

The purpose is to provide a GUI for the catalog of movies that I have seen and that is saved in an xlsx file, with the purpose of simplifying the search for the details of the films.

## Install

```sh
mvn clean install
